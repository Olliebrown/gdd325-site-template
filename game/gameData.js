  description: `
  Lambent Abyss is a 2d, top-down adventure game where you control a treasure seaker and his mysterious companion. Unable to defend yourself you rely on the compaion for light and protection from the bio-luminescent creaturs that make their home in the vault. Each level decends deeper into darkness with your exit left further and further behind, and more questions than answers await you at the bottom.
